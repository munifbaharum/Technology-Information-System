                                        <br><p>For our industry visit 2, due to lack of time - we could only conduct a self-study on a YouTube video related to the topic of AI in Agriculture. Below is a summary of the technologies that could be implemented in the industry, based on the insights we gathered from the video:
                                            <ul>
                                                <br><li>crop monitoring</li>

                                                <li>weeds & pests detection</li>
                                                <li>Irrigation management</li>
                                                <li>harvesting</li>
                                                <li>pollination</li>
                                            </ul><p>Crop monitoring with AI systems such as drones and sensors helps detect issues like diseases and nutrient deficiencies early, improving crop health and yields. Precision farming uses AI to optimize resource use, ensuring water, fertilizers, and pesticides are applied efficiently, reducing waste and environmental impact. In livestock farming, AI-enabled wearables monitor animal health, allowing for early disease detection and better management. Crop and soil analysis powered by AI helps farmers determine the best planting strategies, improving crop productivity.
                                            <p>Crop forecasting uses AI to predict yields based on environmental data, helping farmers plan harvests and reduce waste. Weeds and pests detection through drones and cameras allows for targeted treatments, minimizing pesticide use. AI also enhances irrigation management by analyzing soil moisture and weather data, ensuring efficient water use
                                            <p>Harvesting is automated with AI-driven robots, improving efficiency and reducing labor costs. Lastly, pollination can be assisted by AI robots, ensuring crops are effectively pollinated in areas where natural pollinators are declining.
                                            <p>Reflecting on our self-study for Industry Visit 2, it's clear that AI technologies hold significant potential to revolutionize agriculture. The video provided valuable insights into how AI can improve efficiency, sustainability, and productivity across various aspects of farming. From crop monitoring and precision farming to livestock management and pollination, these advancements offer solutions to many challenges faced by the industry, such as resource waste, labor shortages, and environmental impacts. It was especially interesting to learn how AI can optimize processes like irrigation management and harvesting, making farming more efficient and cost-effective. Overall, this exploration into AI applications in agriculture highlighted the growing importance of technology in modern farming and its potential to create more sustainable and profitable agricultural practices.
