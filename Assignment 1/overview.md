      <p>For Assignment 1, we were required to create a poster for Industry Talk 1, which focused on a presentation about the Petronas Young Talent Program (YTP).</p>
      <p>The Petronas Young Talent Program is an initiative by Petronas, Malaysia's national oil and gas company. The Petronas YTP is aimed at identifying and nurturing young talent in the energy sector. It provides participants with valuable industry experience, focusing on the development of technical, leadership, and professional skills.</p>
      <p>Through mentorship and hands-on learning, the program prepares individuals for future roles within Petronas, while emphasizing sustainability and innovationâ€”key priorities for the company as it moves towards a more sustainable energy future.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the session, I gained a better understanding of how programs like YTP help develop young talent in the energy sector. The focus on real-world experience, mentorship, and sustainability really stood out to me, and it made me realize how valuable these opportunities are for shaping future careers.</p>
      <p>This has motivated me to look into similar programs and think about how they can help me grow professionally. Working on the poster also gave me a deeper appreciation for the impact of the program.</p>
