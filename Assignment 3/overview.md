        <p>For our Industry Talk 2 assignment, we were required to watch a presentation video and prepare an academic report focusing on entrepreneurship in IT, ICT workforce employability in Malaysia, and the knowledge and skills required for success in the industry. The presentation featured two speakers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mohd Hakimi Iqmail</strong> - A project manager at UTMDigital who shared his journey from studying multimedia to leading IT projects and developing systems like the Welfare Services System and Payroll 2.0.</li>
            <li><strong>Nik Muhammad Habibullah</strong> - An entrepreneur and founder of NI Solution, who discussed his experiences in starting a business and helping fresh graduates enhance their employability through services like GetMeHired.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The task required us to summarize their insights on the skills required in the field of Computer Science, including both technical and soft skills, and reflect on how these skills will help us in our future careers. We also explored the importance of adapting to the ever-changing tech industry, emphasizing skills like programming, problem-solving, communication, risk management, and leadership.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Reflecting on this task, I gained a deeper understanding of the critical skills necessary for a successful career in IT and Computer Science. The speakers emphasized that technical proficiency is important, but equally so are soft skills like communication, leadership, and adaptability. I realized that staying curious and continuously improving my programming abilities will be key to thriving in this field.</p>
        <p>Through this assignment, I also became more aware of the importance of soft skills in the workplace. While technical knowledge can get you far, being able to collaborate effectively with others, manage risks, and communicate complex ideas clearly is equally vital. I’m now more motivated to work on these areas, particularly my communication skills, as I can see how they will significantly impact my ability to succeed in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>Overall, this task has given me valuable insights into the skills and mindset required to excel in the ever-evolving tech world, and I’m excited to continue developing these competencies throughout my studies and future career.</p>
